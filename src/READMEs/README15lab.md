# Lab 15: Implement a Binary Tree and a BST

## Challenge:

1. Create a Node class that has properties for value stored, left child, and right child. 
2. Create a BinaryTree class. Define methods for each traversal called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder that return an array ov values ordered appropriately.
3. Create a BinarySearchTree class. Define a method named add to accept a value and add to a new node, and a method named contains to accept a value and return a boolean depending on whether or not the value is in the tree.
