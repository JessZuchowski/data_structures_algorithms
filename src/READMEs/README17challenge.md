# Code Challenge 17: Breadth-first Traversal

## Feature Task:

Write a breadth first traversal method that takes in a binary tree. Using breadth-first traversal, print the value of every visited node. 

## Approach and effeciency:

Breadth-first: visit all nodes of a level before going to the next level. 
1. Add nodes of each level to queue in order. 
2. Remove each node from list and print value.
3. Add children nodes to queue.
