# Breadth-first Graph Traversal

## Challenge

Create a breadth-first traversal method for the graph that accepts a starting node and returns a collection of nodes in visited order. 

## Approach

1. Take in a node as input
2. Visit all neighbor nodes at that level before continuing down
3. Declare a Set<> of visited nodes
4. Declare a Queue<> and add visited nodes
