# Lab 05: Implement a Linked List
## Features:
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node as well as a pointer to the next Node.
2. Within the LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation an empty Linked List should be created. 
3. Define a method called insert that takes in a value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list. 
4. Define a method called includes that takes a value and returns a boolean dependent on whether the value exists in the list. 
5. Define a method called print that returns all the current node values in the Linked List.
