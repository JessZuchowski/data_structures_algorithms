# Lab 05: Linked Lists

## Features:

1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node as well as a pointer to the next Node. 
2. Within the LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created. 
3. Define a method called insert that takes in a value and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) time performance. 
4. Define a method called includes that takes in a value and returns a boolean depending on whether or not that value exists as a value within the Linked List. 
5. Define a method called print that returns a collection of all current Node values.
