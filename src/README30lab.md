# Hashtables

## Challenge

Implement a hashtable with the following methods:
1. add: take in a key and a value as input, hash the key, add key and value pair to table. 
2. get: take in a key as input and return value if present. 
3. contains: take in key as input and return a boolean indicating whether or not the key exists in the table.
4. hash: take in an arbitrary key as input and return its index in the list. 

## Approach

Create a node class and array list. Implement a hash function to find the index of a key. Add key/value pair to hash and insert in to list.
