##Challenge 02: Array Shift
Paired with Merry Cimakasky Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

##Approach and Efficiency
First attempt was at using ArrayList. Changed approach to not use imports.
