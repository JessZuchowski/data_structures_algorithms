# Tree Intersection

## Feature Task

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes in two binary tree parameters. Return a set of values found in both trees. 

## Approach
1. Traverse both trees and push nodes from each tree into a stack (stack 1 for first tree, stack 2 for second tree).
2. If values are the same, pop and add to array. 

## Solution
